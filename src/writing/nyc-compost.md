# NYC Compost Bins

Last night I went and threw my first big batch of compost into an [NYC Compost bin](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dsny/collection/residents/curbside-composting.page).

It's been interesting to learn over the last few months, as NYC has rolled this program out, how this all works:

> Over the last few weeks, I have watched our food waste move from bin to pile to egg, changing from solid to proprietary liquid to gas, ultimately becoming a fuel that powers the machines that make more of it. It’s not exactly the virtuous cycle I had imagined, but neither is it still rotting in a landfill. In some ways, it feels like I have been baptized, too. — [Curbed](https://www.curbed.com/2023/04/smart-bin-compost-journey.html)

There have been [complaints of bins filling up too fast](https://hellgatenyc.com/the-struggle-to-find-an-empty-dsny-compost-smart-bin-is-real/), so I wanted to document my experience in case there are any other organic waste management nerds out there.

## Finding the bin

I noticed there was a bin close to my place a few months ago but it took me a few weeks to actually start remembering to:
- cut produce scraps into smaller pieces
- save my coffee grounds
- remember to put them in the bag in the freezer rather than throw them out

Now that I've re-formed the composting habit (we composted food at my college) it feels good to not be throwing out so much as trash.

So, yesterday, my bag was finally full enough that I decided to compost it. While looking for the app I serendipitously discovered [this 14 minute interview with NYC Sanitation about the new orange smart bins &amp; their app.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=nNGGCFheO8U) Anyway, I downloaded [the iOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nyc-compost/id1596363693) and went to the closest bin with the little map out:

When I got to the bin I looked back at the app and saw it go from:

1. My geolocation being far away ("You must be within reach of a Bin to unlock it.", the "Unlock Bin" button is grayed out)
2. The message goes away, the button labelled "Unlock Bin" turns green
3. It goes orange as it's "Unlocking Bin"
4. Then it goes back to the 1. state

Side note: If you look closely at the top, what do you notice?

There's an NFC symbol on it! Why? Well, what would you do if you don't have a smart phone? [You used to be able to use a keycard instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9nmvR1Q5zw). Sadly, this looks to have differed borough by borough, as this [Medium post from NYC Sanitation said in February 2022](https://nycsanitation.medium.com/smart-bins-new-ways-to-divert-food-waste-and-keep-our-city-green-4858320a3e8):

> We call these bins “smart” because either a key card or a smartphone app is used to access them (we don’t want people mistaking them for trash cans and tossing non-compostable litter). The Astoria bins are accessible with a key card, which you can apply for here — and we plan to have a mobile app available in the coming months. The Lower Manhattan bins are accessible through the mobile app eGate Digi, which you can download from Apple’s App Store or the Google Play Store, or by a QR code on the bins themselves.

Finally, in 2024 the link to the keycard application (smartcompost.nyc) is broken, it's now a dead Squarespace site. I couldn't find any information about members of the public getting these access keycards. Alas, maybe the logistics of handing out physical keycards are too complicated for the city to manage... which is really sad for people without smartphones, or even just people who want to compost but not take their phones with them.

### Conclusion

It's an interesting piece of technology! I'm glad NYC has rolled it out pretty thoroughly and I hope people are using it. At first I thought this was kind of over-engineered, then I remembered [raccoons are incredibly smart trash-panda burglars.](https://youtu.be/8Peuy0FE4X8?si=eXN3M12eoLSVfpm6).

One last thing, because I'm me, I took a 3D scan of the bin with my phone:

Thanks for reading about today's micro-obsession!
